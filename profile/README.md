### Legacy examples

Some of the projects have been used as sample of "legacy" technology since it was a while since they got created. In particular we have these that got started based on example from Galasoft that demonstrated WPF with WCF. I've since used it as a simple example in the line of TodoMVC and TodoMVC backend (but mostly using xml for transport).

- [customer-service](https://github.com/ozzymcduff/customer-service)
- [customer-client-react](https://github.com/ozzymcduff/customer-client-react)
- [customer-client-angular2](https://github.com/ozzymcduff/customer-client-angular2)
- [customer-client-knockout](https://github.com/ozzymcduff/customer-client-knockout)

Using XML for transport has some interesting implications since JSON has since become the defacto standard for Web API's.
